## TL;DR
![](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/0QBlkcCyZmtz.png)
## Right Corner Diagnostics (helix-like diagnostics in neovim)
A simplified rework of [right-corner-diagnostics.nvim](https://github.com/santigo-zero/right-corner-diagnostics.nvim) which is a fork of [trld](https://github.com/Mofiqul/trld.nvim).

## Why another one?
I just did the fork because it didn't work with big diagnostics and I wanted a space between diagnostics, also
its very simplified at the cost of only supporting right-top diagnostics
